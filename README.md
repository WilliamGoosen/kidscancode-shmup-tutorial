A shoot-'em-up game built with Pygame as a learning project.

This code is my implementation of the fantastic ["Shmup" tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsk-HSGFjnaH5yghzu7PcOzm9NhsW0Urw) by [KidsCanCode](https://github.com/kidscancode).

The original tutorial code and structure can be found in their [pygame_tutorials](https://github.com/kidscancode/pygame_tutorials) repository.
